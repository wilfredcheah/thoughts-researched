    { "type": "p", "text": "The semiconductor industry has always fascinated me with its many technical complexities. In my opinion, the technology, i.e., process knowledge and intellectual properties surrounding semiconductors, is the most important human invention in the modern era." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "We are bombarded by news outlets and FinTwit hyping up firms like NVIDIA and Broadcom, fabless design firms which own and design some of the most advanced IPs within the industry, supplying key products like GPUs and ASICs which form the backbone of the computing era, as well as humanity’s venture into AGI." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "However, an area that fascinates me more is with regard to the manufacturing process of semiconductors themselves. We hear of firms like TSMC dominating the wafer fabrication segment, but there is also an entire labyrinth of less well-known firms involved in the most cutting-edge solutions that enable an engineering process which brings these semiconductors to life." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "That area is semiconductor packaging, a less well-known part of the semiconductor value chain due to its sometimes-archaic terms and complexity." },

    { "type": "h3", "text": "What is semiconductor packaging?" },
    { "type": "p", "text": "Semiconductor packaging refers to the manufacturing and assembly of packaging components surrounding a silicon die (Integrated Circuit, or IC) that enables its use in circuitry while ensuring that the IC’s performance and reliability are not compromised." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "The package’s core purpose is to act as an electrical interface between the IC and the outer circuitry, adapting to different sizes and scales of the metal connections located on the IC. This allows for better signal transmission quality between the IC and the PCB. Additionally, the package serves as a physical protective layer for the IC, with the die typically being encapsulated by epoxy or a metal lid." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "Packages are also used to dissipate heat, given that complex ICs produce significant heat that can damage the die. Typically, within the package itself, a thermal interface material is deposited above the die, while the package itself is made out of a thermally conductive encapsulation layer to allow for efficient heat dissipation." },
    { "type": "p", "text": "As packaging technology evolved, complex architectures such as multi-die packages have been deployed to increase both the compute and functionality of the final product. Advanced packaging techniques allow for flexibility in connecting multiple ICs to the outer circuitry." },

    { "type": "h3", "text": "How many types of packaging are there?" },
    { "type": "p", "text": "It is important to distinguish the two main types of packaging discussed here: (1) die-to-interposer packaging techniques, and (2) differing forms of packaging technologies." },

      "Through Silicon Vias (TSV): uses metal pillars called vias running through the dies, enabling stacking of multiple ICs on a single interposer."
